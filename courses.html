            <p class="lead"><strong>What is HTML</strong></p><br>
            <p class="late">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It forms the backbone of every web page and is essential for building websites. Here's a simple breakdown:

                <br> <strong class="high">Key Features of HTML:</strong>
                <br> <strong>Structure Content:</strong> HTML is used to organize content into headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, links, and more.
                <br> <strong>HyperText:</strong> The "hypertext" part allows you to link different web pages or sections using hyperlinks tags. 
                <br> <strong>Markup Language:</strong> It uses tags (enclosed in < >) to define elements and their roles on the page.
                <br> <strong class="high">Common HTML Tags:</strong>
                <br> <strong>h1 to h6:</strong> Headings (H1 is the largest, H6 is the smallest).
                <br> <strong>p:</strong> Paragraphs.
                <br> <strong>a:</strong> Links (anchors).
                <br> <strong>img:</strong> Images.
                <br> <strong>ul and ol:</strong> Unordered and ordered lists.
                <br> <strong>div:</strong> Division or container for grouping content.
                <br> <strong>span:</strong> Inline container for styling text or grouping inline elements.
                <br> <strong class="high">Why HTML is Important:</strong>
                <br> <strong>Foundation of the Web:</strong> All web pages use HTML as the foundation.
                <br> <strong>Customization:</strong> Paired with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for functionality), HTML allows for complete customization of web content.
                <br> <strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> Works across all major web browsers.

                <p class="lead"><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong></p><br>
                <p class="late">Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. These machines are programmed to think, reason, learn, and act like humans. AI aims to enable systems to solve problems, make decisions, and adapt to new information.

                    <br> Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of being manually coded, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on data.
                    <br> <strong class="high"> How Machine Learning Works:</strong>
                    <br> <strong> Data Input:</strong> Provide a dataset for the machine to learn from.
                    <br> <strong> Training:</strong> The machine uses algorithms to find patterns in the data.
                    <br> <strong> Testing:</strong> Validate the machine's understanding using new data.
                    <br> <strong>Prediction/Action:</strong> The machine applies its learning to make predictions or decisions.
                    <br> <strong class="high"> Types of Machine Learning:</strong>
                    <br> <strong> Supervised Learning:</strong> Learning from labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like size, location).
                    <br> <strong> Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Learning from unlabeled data to find hidden patterns (e.g., clustering customer behavior).
                    <br> <strong>Reinforcement Learning: </strong>Learning through trial and error to maximize rewards (e.g., training robots or game-playing AI).
                    <br> <strong class="high">Applications of ML:</strong>
                    <br> <strong>Image and Speech Recognition:</strong> Face recognition, virtual assistants.
                    <br> <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Language translation, sentiment analysis.
                    <br> <strong>Recommendation Systems: </strong>E-commerce product recommendations.
                    <br> <strong>Fraud Detection: </strong>Identifying unusual patterns in financial transactions.
                    <br> <strong class="high">Relation Between AI and ML:</strong>
                    <br> AI is the broader concept, and ML is one way to achieve AI.
                    <br> ML enables AI systems to improve themselves over time without manual intervention.
